      <h4>Bhopal, India:</h4><p> On the night of December 2-3, 1984, the city of Bhopal lay in despair, almost as if it had accepted it fate as dark fog covered the Union Carbide India Limited(UCIL) plant. Something unthinkable had happened. It was as if nature in all its fury hath unleashed itself. Disaster had struck.

<h4>Impact and Timeliness:</h4><p>The very fabric of humanity suffered as we look back on the very obvious and deep scars the tragedy left on us. The leakage of methyl isocyanate on the fateful day might just be the cause of shudders. While that should suffice to describe the pain of those who bore it, let me furnish some numbers. Within mere days of the incident, over 3,000 people were dead. A somewhat coarse estimate of the tragedy says it caused a total of 25,000 people to face their mortal fears over the coming years as a direct impact. Bhopal itself as an immediate aftermath was a scene of much pain and wrath and lay strewn on its grounds people affected. Respiratory problems, blindness, cancer and other various diseases were of the common during that a day. In fact, it left an impact so strong the soil and water contamination in Bhopal still haunt the locals to this day.

<h4>Prominence and Proximity:</h4><p>While of major significance within India, the city of Bhopal was largely unknown to the rest of the world. Such would not be the case for the heart city soon after the disaster as the news spread like wildfire. While negative publicity, it was probably for a good cause. This lead to exposing of vulnerabilities of industrial safety and consequences of corporate negligence. It was also helpful that Union Carbide and it's parent company Dow Chemical from the US were globally famous. This ensured the news jumped into spotlight and actions and preventive measures were rushed in to ensure industrial safety and upholding standards of the highest quality.

<h4>Conflict:</h4>
<p>As is the norm and as must be expected such a disastrous event led to long fought conflicts. Prominent conflicts include those between the survivors and the corporation itself, while Union Carbide also was at legal war with the Indian government. The survivors fought for proper healthcare and medication and while the Indian government had to settle eventually for relatively paltry (given the magnitude of the situation) amount of $ 470 million. This did not stop it from calling names to the CEO of UCIL, Warren Anderson who walked away without trial.

<h4>Human Interest:</h4>
<p> While it sounds like we've been through the worst, it really unfortunately is not the case. Generations on, children there are still being birthed with congenital deficiencies and such was is the legacy of the toxic gas. NGOs and other activists round India continue to fight for and support these children.

<h4>Conclusion: </h4><p>The Bhopal gas tragedy remains a stark reminder of the catastrophic potential of industrial negligence and the pressing need for stringent safety regulations. Nearly 40 years later, the memory does not fade, making it one of the most prolonged human interest stories of our time.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
